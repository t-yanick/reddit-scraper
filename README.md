## Concept

## Getting Started
> To get a local copy running, follow the steps below:
- Visit the main page of the repository
- Click on the `Code` button
- Clone it using `git clone`

### Prerequisites
- Ruby Version 2.7.0

### Setup
- Open to the terminal on your local PC
- Type ``` git clone ```
- Paste the link from the repository you copied when you clicked on ```Code```
- Type ```bundle install` to install the gems
- Type `cd bin` to change directory to bin
- Type `ruby main.rb` to run the program

### Running the program

## Running tests with Rspec

This scraper was tested with Rspec wich is a computer domain-specific language (DSL) testing tool written in programming language Ruby to test Ruby code. It is a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework which is extensively used in production applications.

## How to get Rspec running

- In the terminal, type `gem install rspec`
- Once done, go to project directory and type `rspec --init`
- You will see a folder `spec` and a file `.rspec`
- Inside spec folder you'll see a `spec_helper.rb` file.
- In the terminal, type `rspec`
